Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


1.  Introduction

   Historically, domain name registries have applied a simple fee
   structure for billable transactions, namely a basic unit price
   applied to domain <create>, <renew>, <transfer> and RGP [RFC3915]
   restore commands.  Given the relatively small number of EPP servers
   to which EPP clients have been required to connect, it has generally
   been the case that client operators have been able to obtain details
   of these fees out-of-band by contacting the server operators.

   Given the present expansion of the DNS namespace, and the
   proliferation of novel business models, it is now desirable to
   provide a method for EPP clients to query EPP servers for the fees
   and credits associated with certain commands and specific objects.

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This EPP mapping
   provides a mechanism by which EPP clients may query the fees and
   credits associated with various billable transactions, and also
   obtain their current account balance.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   "fee" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:fee-0.5".  The XML namespace prefix "fee" is
   used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and instead employ a
   proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to interpret and
   output the XML documents.

   The XML namespace prefix above contains a version number,
   specifically "0.5".  This version number will increment with
   successive versions of this document, and will reach 1.0 if and when
   this document is published as an RFC.  This permits clients to
   distinguish which version of the extension a server has implemented.

Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


2.1.  Client Commands

   The <fee:command> element is used in EPP <check> and <info> commands
   to determine the fee which is applicable to the given command.

   The element values permitted by the server is a matter of repository
   policy, but MUST include as a minimum the following values:

   o  "create" indicating a <domain:create> command;

   o  "renew" indicating a <domain:renew> command;

   o  "transfer" indicating a <domain:transfer> command;

   If the server supports the Registry Grace Period Mapping [RFC3915],
   then the server MUST also support the "restore" value.

   The <fee:command> element MAY have an OPTIONAL "phase" attribute
   specifying a launch phase as described in
   [draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase].  It may also contain an OPTIONAL
   "subphase" attribute identifying the custom or sub-phase as described
   in [draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase].

2.2.  Currency Codes

   The <fee:currency> element is used to indicate which currency fees
   are charged in.  This value of this element MUST be a three-character
   currency code from [ISO4217].

   Note that ISO 4217 provides the special "XXX" code, which MAY be used
   if the server uses a non-currency based system for assessing fees,
   such as a system of credits.

   The use of <fee:currency> elements in command frames is OPTIONAL: if
   a <fee:currency> element is not present in a command frame, the
   server MUST determine the currency based on the client's account
   settings which MUST be agreed by the client and server via an out-of-
   band channel.  However, <fee:currency> element MUST be present in
   response frames.

   Servers SHOULD NOT perform a currency conversion if a client uses an
   incorrect currency code.  Servers SHOULD return an error instead.

2.3.  Registration Periods

   The <fee:period> element is used to indicate the units to be added to
   the registration period of domain names by the <create>, <renew> and
   <transfer> commands.  This element is derived from the <domain:

Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


   period> element described in [RFC5731].

   The <fee:period> element is OPTIONAL in command frames: if ommitted,
   the server MUST determine the fee(s) using a validity period of 1
   year.  The <fee:period> element MUST be present in response frames.

2.4.  Fees and Credits

   Servers which implement this extension will include elements in
   response frames which provide information about the fees and/or
   credits associated with a given billable transaction.

   The <fee:fee> and <fee:credit> elements are used to provide this
   information.  The presence of a <fee:fee> element in a response
   indicates a debit against the client's account balance; a <fee:
   credit> element indicates a credit.  A <fee:fee> element MUST have a
   non-negative value.  A <fee:credit> element MUST have a negative
   value.

   A server MAY respond with multiple <fee:fee> and <fee:credit>
   elements in the same response.  In such cases, the net fee or credit
   applicable to the transaction is the arithmetic sum of the values of
   each of the <fee:fee> or <fee:credit> elements.

   <fee:fee> and <fee:credit> elements MAY have an OPTIONAL
   "description" attribute which provides a human-readable description
   of the fee.  Servers SHOULD provide documentation on the possible
   values of this attribute, and their meanings.

   <fee:fee> elements MAY have an OPTIONAL "refundable" attribute which
   takes a boolean value.  Fees may be refunded under certain
   circumstances, such as when a domain application is rejected (as
   described in [draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase]) or when a domain name
   is deleted during the relevant Grace Period (see below).  If the
   "refundable" attribute is omitted, then the default value of "1"
   should be assumed (i.e. the fee is refundable).

2.4.1.  Grace Periods

   [RFC3915] describes a system of "grace periods", which are time
   periods following a billable transaction during which, if a domain
   name is deleted, the client receives a refund.

   The "grace-period" attribute MAY be used to indicate the relevant
   grace period for a fee.  If a server implements the Registry Grace
   Period Servers extension, it SHOULD specify the grace period for all
   relevant transactions.  If no "grace-period" attribute value is
   provided, then no grace period is applicable.

Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


   If a <fee:fee> element has a "grace-period" attribute then it MUST
   also be refundable.  If the "refundable" attribute of a <fee:fee>
   element evaluates to false then it MUST NOT have a "grace-period"
   attribute.

2.5.  Account Balance

   The <fee:balance> element is an OPTIONAL element which MAY be
   included in server responses to transform commands.  If present, it
   can be used by the client to determine the remaining credit at the
   server.

   Whether or not the <fee:balance> is included in response frames is a
   matter of server policy.  However, if a server chooses to offer
   support for this element, it MUST be included in responses to all
   domain "transform" commands (ie <create>, <renew>, <update>,
   <delete>, <transfer op="request">).

   The value of the <fee:balance> MAY be negative.  A negative balance
   indicates that the server has extended a line of credit to the client
   (see below).

   When a server includes a <fee:balance> element in response to
   transform commands, the value of the element MUST reflect the
   client's account balance after any fees or credits associated with
   that command have been applied.

2.6.  Credit Limit

   As described above, if a server returns a response frame containing a
   <fee:balance> with a negative value, then the server has extended a
   line of credit to the client.  A server MAY also include a <fee:
   creditLimit> element in responses which indicates the maximum credit
   available to a client.  A server MAY reject certain transactions if
   the absolute value of the <fee:balance> is equal to or exceeds the
   value of the <fee:creditLimit> element.

   Whether or not the <fee:creditLimit> is included in response frames
   is a matter of server policy.  However, if a server chooses to offer
   support for this element, it MUST be included in responses to all
   domain "transform" commands (ie <create>, <renew>, <update>,
   <delete>, <transfer op="request">).

2.7.  Classification of Domain Names

   Domain names may be assigned to a particular class, category, or
   tier, each of which has a particular fee or set of fess associated
   with it.  The <fee:class> element which appears in <check> and <info>

Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


   responses is used to indicate the classification of a domain name.

   If a server makes use of this element, it MUST provide clients with a
   list of all the values that the element may take via an out-of-band
   channel.  Servers MUST NOT use values which do not appear on this
   list.


3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in [RFC5730].

3.1.  EPP Query Commands

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <poll> command or
   response.

3.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension defines additional elements for the EPP <check>
   command.

   The command frame MAY contain an <extension> element which MAY
   contain a <fee:check> element.  The <fee:check> element MUST contain
   at least one <fee:domain> element, with the following child elements:

   o  A <fee:name> element.  The domain name need not correspond to a
      <domain:name> element that appears in the <domain:check> element
      of the main body of the frame.

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:currency> element;

   o  A <fee:command> element;

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:period> element.

   Example <check> command:

   MUST contain the following child elements:

   o  A <fee:name> element that contains a domain name which matches the
      name in the corresponding <fee:check> element.

   o  A <fee:currency> element that contains same currency code that
      appeared in the corresponding <fee:check> element.  If no <fee:
      currency> element appeared in the corresponding <fee:check>
      element, then the client's default billing currency should be
      used.

   o  A <fee:command> element that contains same command that appeared
      in the corresponding <fee:check> element.  This element MAY have
      the OPTIONAL "phase" and "subphase" elements, which MUST match the
      same attributes in the corresponding <fee:check> element.

   o  A <fee:period> element that contains same unit that appeared in
      the corresponding <fee:check> element.  If no <fee:period>
      appeared in the corresponding <fee:check> element, then this
      element MUST have a value of 1 year.

   o  One or more <fee:fee> elements.

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:class> element.

Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


3.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension defines additional elements for the EPP <info>
   command.

   The command frame MAY contain an <extension> element which contains a
   <fee:info> element with the following child elements:

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:currency> element;

   o  A <fee:command> element;

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:period> element.

   Example <info> command:

   C: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
   C: <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:   <command>
   C:     <info>
   C:       <domain:info
   C:         xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
   C:         <domain:name hosts="all">example.com</domain:name>
   C:       </domain:info>
   C:     </info>
   C:     <extension>
   C:       <fee:info xmlns:fee="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:fee-0.5">
   C:         <fee:currency>USD</fee:currency>
   C:         <fee:command phase="sunrise">create</fee:command>
   C:         <fee:period unit="y">1</fee:period>
   C:       </fee:info>
   C:     </extension>
   C:     <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:   </command>
   C: </epp>

   When the server receives an <info> command that includes the
   extension element described above, its response MUST (subject to the
   exceptions described below) contain an <extension> element, which
   MUST contain a child <fee:infData> element.  The <fee:infData> MUST
   contain the following child elements:

   o  A <fee:currency> element that contains same currency code that
      appeared in the <fee:currency> element element of the command
      frame.  If no <fee:currency> element appeared in the command
      frame, then the client's default billing currency should be used.

Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


   o  A <fee:command> element that contains same command that appeared
      in the <fee:command> element of the command frame.  This element
      MAY have the OPTIONAL "phase" and "subphase" elements, which MUST
      match the same attributes in the <fee:command> element of the
      command frame.

   o  A <fee:period> element that contains same unit that appeared in
      the corresponding <fee:period> element of the command frame.  If
      no <fee:period> appeared in the command frame, then this element
      MUST have a value of 1 year.

   o  One or more <fee:fee> elements.

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:class> element.

   If the domain name requested in the command is invalid, sponsored by
   another client, or otherwise ineligible for registration, the server
   MAY choose to omit the <fee:infData> element and return an error
   instead.

   When the <transfer> query command has been processed successfully,
   the client selected the extension when it logged in, and the client
   is authorised by the server to view information about the transfer,
   the server MAY include in the <extension> section of the EPP response
   a <fee:trnData> element that contains the following child elements:

   o  A <fee:currency> element.

   o  one or more <fee:fee> elements containing the fees associated with
      the transfer.

   If no <fee:trnData> element is included in the response, then no fee
   will be assessed by the server for the transfer.

3.2.  EPP Transform Commands

3.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension adds elements to both the EPP <create> command and
   response, when the extension has been selected during a <login>
   command.

   When submitting a <create> command to the server, the client MAY
   include in the <extension> element a <fee:create> element which
   includes the following child elements:

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:currency> element;

   o  One or more <fee:fee> elements.

   Depending on server policy, the server MAY choose to accept or refuse

   the command depending on whether the currency and fees provided by
   the client agrees with the server's own calculation of the fees.  If
   the server chooses to refuse the command due to incorrect fees, it
   MUST respond with a 2004 "Parameter value range" error.

   A server MAY require the currency and fees to be provided for the
   command.  If the server chooses to refuse the command due to missing
   fees, it MUST response with a 2003 "Required parameter missing"
   error.

   When the <create> command has been processed successfully, and the
   client selected the extension when it logged in, and a fee was
   assessed by the server for the transaction, the server MUST include
   in the <extension> section of the EPP response a <fee:creData>
   element that contains the following child elements:

   o  A <fee:currency> element;

   o  One or more <fee:fee> elements;

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:balance> element;

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:creditLimit> element.

   If no <fee:creData> element is included in the response, then no fee
   has been assessed by the server for this transaction.

3.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension adds elements to both the EPP <transfer> command and
   response, when the value of the "op" attribute of the <transfer>
   command element is "request", and the extension has been selected
   during the <login> command.

   When submitting a <transfer> command to the server, the client MAY
   include in the <extension> element a <fee:transfer> element which
   includes the following child elements:

   o  A <fee:currency> element;

   o  One or more <fee:fee> elements.

   Depending on server policy, the server MAY choose to accept or refuse
   the command depending on whether the currency and fees provided by
   the client agrees with the server's own calculation of the fees.  If
   the server chooses to refuse the command due to incorrect fees, it
   MUST respond with a 2004 "Parameter value range error".

Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


   A server MAY require the currency and fees to be provided for the
   command.  If the server chooses to refuse the command due to missing
   fees, it MUST response with a 2003 "Required parameter missing"
   error.

   When the <transfer> command has been processed successfully, and the
   client selected the extension when it logged in, the server MAY
   include in the <extension> section of the EPP response a <fee:
   trnData> element that contains the following child elements:

   o  A <fee:currency> element;

   o  One or more <fee:fee> elements;

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:balance> element;

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:creditLimit> element.

   If no <fee:transfData> element is included in the response, then no
   fee has been assessed by the server for this transaction.

   MUST respond with a 2004 "Parameter value range error".

   A server MAY require the currency and fees to be provided for the
   command.  If the server chooses to refuse the command due to missing

   element that contains the following child elements:

   o  A <fee:currency> element;

   o  One or more <fee:fee> elements;

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:balance> element;

   o  An OPTIONAL <fee:creditLimit> element.

   If no <fee:upData> element is included in the response, then no fee
   has been assessed by the server for this transaction.

4.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [RFC5730], the EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731], and protocol layers used by EPP.  The
   security considerations described in these other specifications apply
   to this specification as well.


5.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  Two URI

Internet-Draft       Registry Fee Extension for EPP            June 2014


   2.  added extension elements for <create>, <renew>, <transfer> and
       <update> so that the server can reject the command if the fee is
       incorrect.

7.2.  Changes from 01 to 02

   1.   Use Internet-Draft version number rather than XML namespace
        version number in this section.

   2.   Support for multiple <fee:fee> and <fee:credit> elements.

   3.   Added the "description" attribute to <fee:fee> and <fee:credit>
        elements.

   4.   Added the <fee:balance> element.

   5.   added the <fee:creditLimit> element.

   6.   Updated reference to [draft-ietf-eppext-launchphase].

   7.   Use <fee:command> instead of <fee:action>.

   8.   Use a single child element of <fee:chkData> instead of multiple
        elements for each domain.  This also requires using a different
        name (<fee:name>) for the domain name.

   9.   Added the "refundable" attribute to <fee:fee> elements.

   10.  Added the "grace-period" attribute to <fee:fee> elements.
